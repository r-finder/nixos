# Nixos Setup for minimalist desktop, WIP

Features:
- Sway as a main WM. Hyprland as an alternative, just in case I get a desktop PC with NVIDIA GPU (which I intend)
- Obsidian, quite unstable with the modern Electron. Thinking about an alternative
- VSCode, same problem as Obsidian. Plus Microsoft being Microsoft. Changed to VSCodium, will keep it until my vim skill improves
- TLP profile for power management, aimed for best battery life
